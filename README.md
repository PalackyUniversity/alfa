# Alfan
Program with graphical user interface for analyzing and evaluating field heights over time captured by LiDAR on a drone.  

## How it works

In `main-part1.py` program for each `las` file in `data` folder:
1. Loads 3D `las` file
2. Removes 3D points with bigger value than 99.9% quantile and lower than 0.1% quantile
3. Subtracts minimal `X`, `Y`, `Z` value and saves that values into `info.json`
4. Normalizes `X`, `Y` axes, then scales them by `WH_SCALE` factor
5. Normalizes `Z` axis, then scales it to 16bit image
6. Uses **dynamic averaging** - multiple 3D points at the same position in pixel grid are averaged, then 3D point count is visualized in `1_count.png` 

![Count](docs/1_count_compressed.jpg "Count")

7. Converts 3D data into 2D pixel grid, saves it into `1_original.png`

![Original](docs/1_original_compressed.jpg "Original")

8. Makes **median** of `1_original.png` that ignores zeroes when calculating median and then every black pixel replaces with median value => maximizes information from just few 3D points. Then saves it into `2_median.png`

![Median](docs/2_median_compressed.jpg "Median")

In `main-part2.py` then for last image in time series:

1. User rotates image using GUI, so that longer sides of blocks of field are vertical, program saves it into `3_rotated.png`

![Rotation](docs/3_rotated_compressed.jpg "Rotation")

2. User selects field for analysis from rotated image using GUI, program saves it into `4_cropped.png`

![Crop](docs/4_cropped_compressed.jpg "Crop")

3. Program automatically rotates and crops all other images

In `main-part3.py` program:
1. Sums all images into one image, saves it into `0_sum.png`

![Sum](docs/0_sum_compressed.png "Sum")

2. Sums summed image over vertical axis, applies **log** for better processing, saves it into `blocks_sum.png`

![Blocks sum](docs/blocks_sum.png "Blocks sum")

3. Detects starting and ending edges of blocks using first derivative, saves it into `blocks_derivative.png`

![Blocks derivative](docs/blocks_derivative.png "Blocks derivative")

4. Separates each block into separate image, saves example output in new folder - e.g. `block_1/0_block.png`

![Block](docs/0_block_compressed.jpg "Block")

5. Split block into upper and bottom part

For upper and bottom part program:
1. Sums block over vertical axis, applies **log** for better processing, e.g. saves it into `block_1/fit_up_sum.png`

![Fit sum](docs/fit_up_sum.png "Fit sum")

2. Detects starting and ending edges of sub-blocks using first derivative, e.g. saves it into `block_1/fit_up_derivative.png`

![Fit derivative](docs/fit_up_derivative.png "Fit derivative")

Then program puts upper and bottom edge detections together and:

1. Detects deformation

<!-- ![Block deformation](docs/0_block_compressed.png "Block deformation") -->

![Block deformation draw](docs/0_block_draw_compressed.jpg "Block deformation draw")

2. Removes deformation

<!-- ![Without deformation](docs/1_warped_compressed.png "Without deformation") -->

![Without deformation draw](docs/1_warped_draw_compressed.jpg "Without deformation draw")

3. Applies local maxima filter (with kernel size 1/10 sub-block width)

![Maxima](docs/1_warped_max_compressed.jpg "Maxima")

Finally, for each sub-block program:

1. Subtracts from it the same sub-block from first las file (the earliest record in time series when nothing has grown yet = terrain)

2. Computes:
   - Mean
   - Standard deviation
   - Median
   - Minimum
   - Maximum
   - Quantiles - 1%, 5%, 25%, 75%, 95%, 99%
   - Relative growth rate using formula:

</p>

3. Some keys saves into `statistics.csv`

4. Key enumerating image is saved into `4_cropped_draw.png`

![Analysis](docs/4_cropped_draw_compressed.jpg "Analysis")

Matlab program fits sigmoid for each growth curve with parameters A, B, C:

## Validation

### Reference height validation

Reference height validation is important for understanding how much is LiDAR accurate. It is determined by subtracting LiDAR measured height from referenced height measured manually.

#### Error (difference) distribution statistics

| Metric | Value [m] | Value of absolute error [m] |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Mean   | 0.0050    | 0.0410                      |
| STD    | 0.0523    | 0.0325                      |
| Median | 0.0062    | 0.0334                      |
| Q25    | -0.0252   | 0.0144                      |
| Q75    | 0.0359    | 0.0579                      |
| Min    | -0.1335   | 0.0020                      |
| Max    | 0.1312    | 0.1335                      |
| RMSD   | 0.0522    | -                           |

## Performance

Code is also optimized for speed. Critical parts of code are written in C and compiled with `gcc` compiler. On low budget PC it takes lower tens of seconds. The most of the time takes loading big unprocessed `las` files.

Compared to existing [solutions](https://github.com/UPOL-Plant-phenotyping-research-group/UAV-crop-analyzer), this program is about **100x** faster even when using just single core of CPU.

## Install on Debian based Linux:

### Install Python3 and gcc

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip build-essential
```

### Install Python packages
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Compile main.c

```bash
gcc -shared -o main.so main.c
```

## Run
0. Setup working directory as `/project/root/path`
1. Paste/move your las files into data folder (match folder and file structure)
2. Run `python3 main-part1.py` to generate images
3. Run `python3 main-part2.py`
   1. Rotate image using arrows, so field blocks lines are vertical
   2. Press *enter* or key *q*
   3. Select upper left corner using *arrows* to crop
   4. Press *enter* or key *q*
   5. Select bottom right corner using *arrows* to crop
   6. Press *enter* or key *q*
4. Run `python3 main-part3.py` to create analysis
5. Results are in `results` folder
6. Run Matlab code

### Validation
To run validation, you need to have `las` or `txt` file with reference heights. Then you can save them into `calibration` folder. Then paste this to terminal: `python3 tools/validate_heights.py`

## Tested on:
- MacOS 12 Python 3.8
- Ubuntu 22.04 Python 3.10


## TODO
- [ ] Optimize for multicore processors
- [ ] Optimize for low RAM computers
- [ ] Object Oriented Programming?
- [ ] Python classes for dicts with standardized keysÂ¨
- [ ] More robust sub-field search? 
  - Find missing peaks by fitting periodic function?
